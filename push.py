""" This script aims to automate the process of starting frida-server
on an Android device (for now). The script is a part of AndroidTamer
project and is based on this issue: 
https://github.com/AndroidTamer/Tools_Repository/issues/234.

This script performs following things:
1. Try to determine the device architecture
2. Download the frida-server and extract it
3. Push it to the device and execute it
4. Save the PID of the process and write it to 'frida.pid' file.

#Todo:
* Better exception handling.
* Implement better/robust architecture detection code
* Implement for more devices
* Implement the feature to kill frida-server afterwards
